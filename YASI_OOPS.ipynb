        "1. Public attributes: Attributes that are accessible from anywhere in the program.\n",
        "2. Private attributes: Attributes that are prefixed with double underscore (__) and are intended to be private. Python performs name mangling on these attributes, making them more difficult to access directly.\n",

        "Why Python doesn't support method overloading:\n",

        "Python's dynamic typing and flexible function definition make method overloading less necessary. Instead, Python developers often use default argument values or variable-length argument lists to achieve similar functionality.\n",
